# Product Context: Custom Spells 5e

## Problem Statement
D&D 5e GMs often need to create custom spells but lack tools integrated with their VTT. Current solutions require:
- Manual data entry
- External tools without Foundry integration
- Workarounds that break system compatibility

## Solution Approach
This module provides:
1. In-Foundry spell creation
2. Template-based system
3. Data import from spreadsheets
4. Full D&D5e system integration

## User Workflows
### GM Creating Spells
1. Open spell creator interface
2. Select template or start from scratch
3. Configure spell attributes
4. Save to compendium

### Player Using Spells
1. Access spells from compendium
2. Drag to character sheet
3. Use normally like system spells

## FoundryVTT Integration
- Hooks into D&D5e system
- Uses Foundry's document system
- Follows Foundry UI patterns
- Maintains compatibility with other modules
